    Gig Local is a not-for-profit community-driven website to share small music gigs at bars, pubs and cafes in your
    local area. This isn't for big ticketed events, but rather local artists playing an acoustic set in a pub
    courtyard or a jazz trio busting out tunes in a local bar. The idea came from our love to see some music on a
    Sunday afternoon or finish off a night with some live tunes, but struggling to easily find out what's on. We
    love to see new local artists and hope this helps spread the word!
